# LNU-IoT-Course-Project
The project of my course in IoT at LNU
Most of our applications in pulp & paper industry we use seals and bearings that are working under high temperature circumstance. Both of these types of components has cooling media: oil for bearings and water for seals. My project intend to design a sysetem reads media temperature continuously, send read values as MQTT messages  and accordingly should the system decide whether the machine will continue to rotate or it stop to protect the bearing or seal from damage. This system can be used either as protection unit for a rotating machine  or as a part of test station.
