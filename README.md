# Machine Health Monitoring System
IoT course project at LNU
# Project objective
Most of our applications in pulp & paper industry we use seals and bearings that are working under high temperature circumstance and contaains rotors. Bearing and seals have cooling media: oil for bearings and water for seals. My project intend to design a system reads media temperature and revolutions number of rotor continuously, and visualize these parameters to monitor mahine health remotely.

This system can be used either as prediction tool for any trouble or as "Black Box" in case of machine trip.
# Roadmap
- IDE: Arduino C++
- MCU: Heltec LoRa32, installed drivers, checked the pinmap, have some issues with libraries.
- Sensors: did not test yet.
- Network protocol: I have tested the connection with WiFi
- Data visualization on Adafruit, created account,published from Heltec board to a specific feed.
